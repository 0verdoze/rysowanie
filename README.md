# Simple paint that allows to export drawings to Octave

This was created as a cheat tool to help during test from Octave (unfortunately i didn't get to use this in the end)

Assigment was simple, we get a shape on exam, and have to recreate it with Octave plot functions
This tool allows user to draw shapes (instead of coding them), and export code that will draw exactly same thing in Octave

UI bases on [this tutorial](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/build-drawing-app-html-canvas-javascript/), with many additions
Almost all of javascript (or actually typescript in this scenario) is written by me
